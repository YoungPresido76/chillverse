          <ul>
            <li>Service providers who assist us in operating the Platform, including hosting and database infrastructure, and analytics providers</li>
            <li>Paystack, our third-party payment processor, to process Diamond purchases and Chillverse Pro subscription payments</li>

        <Section id="s5" title="5. Halo AI and Automated Processing">
          <p>Halo AI is an in-app assistant that answers questions about Chillverse and, where relevant, your own account activity. When you send Halo AI a message, your question is processed by third-party AI infrastructure providers in order to generate a response. Where a personalized answer is helpful, Halo AI may also look up your own gameplay data — such as your rank, streaks, and recent game history — to include in that response. Halo AI only ever accesses the data of the account asking the question; it cannot access another player's information.</p>
          <p>Your conversations with Halo AI, including the questions you ask and the answers given, are logged and retained for quality assurance, abuse prevention, and product improvement purposes, as described further in Section 6.</p>
          <p>Halo AI is an automated system, and its responses are generated, not written by a human in real time. Responses are provided for general, informational purposes about the Platform and should not be relied upon as professional, financial, medical, or legal advice.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section id="s6" title="6. Data Retention">
          <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. Some content is subject to shorter retention by design — for example, Highlights are automatically removed from view 5 days after posting. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time from within the app or by contacting us. Some information, including certain transaction records and Halo AI conversation logs, may be retained for a longer period for legal, safety, or compliance purposes even after account deletion, though it will no longer be linked to your identity once your account is deleted.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section id="s7" title="7. Your Rights and Choices">
          <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
            <li>Correct inaccurate or incomplete information</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your personal information</li>
            <li>Object to or restrict certain processing activities</li>
            <li>Data portability — receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format</li>
            <li>Opt out of marketing communications at any time</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent</li>

        <Section id="s9" title="9. Children's Privacy">
