// src/features/economy/ProfileEffectPreview.tsx
//
// Discord-style "this is what others see when they view your profile"
// preview, used from the Mall's Profile Card Effect item sheet. It draws
// up your REAL profile (the same ProfilePreviewModal used everywhere else
// in the app — full header, bio, member since, etc.) and layers the
// effect's video on top of it, exactly like the reference screenshots.
//
// Both this component's overlay/video/banner layer AND ProfilePreviewModal
// itself are portaled straight to document.body. That's not optional here:
// AppLayout wraps every page's content in <main className="relative z-10">,
// which — because it combines position with a z-index — is itself a
// stacking context. Anything rendered through the normal page tree,
// however high its own z-index, is capped inside that z-10 context and
// can never paint above something that escaped it. Sliding the Mall item
// sheet out of the way (see Mall.tsx) fixed the *local* trap from that
// sheet's own backdrop-filter, but this outer one is a separate, app-wide
// wrapper that can't be animated away — a portal is the only way out of it,
// which is exactly why ProfilePreviewModal (already portaled) always
// rendered correctly while this layer, sitting in the normal tree, didn't.
//
// The video sits in its own layer with pointer-events: none, and the
// profile card underneath is rendered with isPreview, which makes the
// whole card untappable and hides the owner-only controls (Edit Profile,
// Refer & Earn, Achievements) that have no business being on a "this is
// what others see" preview. Tapping anywhere closes the preview and drops
// back to the item's buy sheet, which is still mounted underneath — it
// just slides itself out of the way while this is open instead of
// competing with this layer for stacking order.
