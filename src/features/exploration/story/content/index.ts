// Merges every map's story content into the single STORY_CONTENT lookup
// Exploration.tsx reads from (mapId -> chamberId -> ChamberStory). Maps
// with no authored story simply have no key here — getCheckpoint() in
// Exploration.tsx already treats a missing entry as "no story content,"
// so adding a new region is just adding its import + spread below, no
// other change needed at the call site.
