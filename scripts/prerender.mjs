#!/usr/bin/env node
// scripts/prerender.mjs
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// Chillverse is a client-rendered React SPA. Without this script, Vercel's
// SPA rewrite (see vercel.json) serves the EXACT SAME dist/index.html for
// every route. That means /privacy, /terms, /login, and /signup all show
// the homepage's title, description, and OG image to anything that doesn't
// execute JavaScript — Bing, Discord, WhatsApp, Slack, X/Twitter unfurlers,
// and most AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, etc.) never run
// the JS bundle, so they only ever saw one page's worth of metadata for the
// whole site.
//
// This script runs after `vite build` (see package.json) and writes a real
// dist/<route>/index.html for each public route with its own <title>,
// meta description, canonical URL, Open Graph / Twitter Card tags, and
// JSON-LD — plus real visible text inside #root so a non-JS crawler sees
// actual content, not an empty div.
//
// React still takes over once JS loads: main.tsx uses
// ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(...) — NOT hydrateRoot — so it safely
// wipes and replaces whatever's already in #root. There is no hydration-
// mismatch risk from the static content below differing slightly from the
// live React output.
//
// MAINTENANCE
// -----------
// The text in ROUTES[].content is a snapshot for crawlers, mirrored from
// Privacy.tsx / Terms.tsx. If you edit the wording of the Privacy Policy or
// Terms in those React components, update the matching entry below too —
// otherwise the crawlable version will drift from what users actually see.
// (A future improvement: move legal copy into a single shared JSON/data file
// imported by both the React component and this script, so there's only one
// place to edit. Flagged as a follow-up, not done here to avoid changing
// your component structure without you reviewing it first.)

        <p style="color:#a8a8b8;line-height:1.7;font-size:15px;margin-bottom:32px">
          Chillverse exists to make casual gaming social again. Every session feeds into your XP,
          your streak, your rank, and your standing with friends — free for anyone to join.

          <li><strong>Games</strong> — Whot, Colour Block, Tac Zone, and more, solo or multiplayer.</li>
          <li><strong>XP & Ranks</strong> — a 6-tier ladder from Rookie to Diamond, earned entirely through play.</li>
          <li><strong>Daily Streaks</strong> — milestones from 1 to 365 days award bonus XP.</li>
          <li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> — real-time global rankings.</li>
          <li><strong>Profiles & Badges</strong> — followers, wishlist, achievements, avatars, badge collection.</li>

          Chillverse launched with its core experience — chat, social features, standard game
          sessions, and a profile and wallet system — and has since shipped further Version
          upgrades adding animation and visual polish. Chillverse was founded and built by
          <strong> Victor_vk</strong>.
